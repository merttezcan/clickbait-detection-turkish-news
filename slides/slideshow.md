# Problem Definition

- Clickbait titles are misleading and they are not informative.

- Clickbait titles are used to attract users to click on the news article.

- By predicting clickbait titles, we can prevent users from being misled.

---

# Dataset Characterization

- 20,036 news article titles collected from different news websites

- 10,030 clickbait titles and 10,006 non-clickbait titles

- There are 4 columns named as "id", "clickbait" (label), "site" and "title". Only the title and label are useful, but I can extract some more features from title.

- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suleymancan/turkishnewstitle20000clickbaitclassified)

# Research Questions

- How can we convert the clickbait titles into a meaningful representation for the machine learning models?

- How can we extract some features from the clickbait titles?

- Which machine learning model is the best for clickbait detection? Do we also need to use deep learning models?

---

# Methodology

- Data Preprocessing

- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Feature Extraction

- Tokenization, Vectorization

- Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.) I can try to use all and compare the results.

- Parameter Tuning, to improve the performance of the models.

- Evaluation

# Expected Challenges

- NLP is not the topic of the course

- Implementing it for Turkish language could be a challenge
